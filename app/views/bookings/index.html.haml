        Project Escape is a TEAM experience.  Get together your brightest group of friends (or the funnest!), and get ready for a
        brand new type of live cooperative gaming experience!
      %h3
        %b Project Escape is fun for all ages!
      %p.indent
        Our Escape Rooms are said to be quite difficult, however we offer a dynamic difficulty curve that allows
        all age groups to have fun.  We've found that children ages 12 and up can contribute to the puzzles, while
        younger children love the overall look and feel of the room, and always surprise the older crowd by thinking outside the box!
      %p.indent
        %b *All minors (under 18) require adult supervision inside the room.
